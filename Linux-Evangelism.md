# Linux Evangelism
###### Here we evangelize all students to use Linux!
TactLabs conducted a small case study in 2014 to analyze whether working with Linux like OS will increase the problem solving skills comparing Windows OS. 

It turns out the developers/students worked on Linux distros have higher problem solving and critical reasoning skills than the dev/students used Windows.

After analyzing our case study, we came up with a program called Linux Evangelism and share the Linux good news to all students in Canada and India.

Here are the list of students to got baptised with Linux since 2020 Aug:
