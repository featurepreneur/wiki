# Zero Slides Policy
###### no more slides

As TactLabs strictly follows No Slides policy, we try to avoid powerpoint sllides/google slides for any of our teaching activities or sessions.

As slides are making the learners boring and sleep (of course in our small case study we found this), we tend to stay away from slides in our sessions.

If you can come up with a better idea on how to show slides related topic in a better tool, please let us know. We are ready to experiment!

Again, **Zero Slides at Featurepreneur~**
