## How do we select the writer of the week?

At Featurepreneur, we use tri-scoring system.

- Featurepreneur admin score
- Machine Learning score
- Community score (Social score)

For each article, our machine learning analyzer will emit the score based on the richness of the content and emit the score. Also, other score collected by admin and the community.
