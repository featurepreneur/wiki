# Featurepreneur vs Entrepreneur
#### How do we differ from Entrepreneurship?

---

> Startup is a High Risk
>
> Featurepreneur is a calculated risk with safety net

Unlike Entrepreneurship, you don't need to focus on scaling your product by doing big marketing and chasing the investors constantly with huge worries. 

Instead of worrying about scaling your product and wait for somone to like your product, you can work on bunch of features to find whether your audience like the feature or not. You don't need hire external marketing/sales teams to start selling your product. 

However, Featurepreneur might be the first step to the entrepreneurial journey as you have done the first level work and try to understand what the community wants.
