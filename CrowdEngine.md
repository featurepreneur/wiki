# CrowdEngine
###### Let the crowd feed this engine!

**What is CrowdEngine?** 

This is an open source engine where contributors can collect the data and dump into the engine. The engine will do the clean up work and funnel it to the open source research projects.

**Does it have any benefits?** 

Yes, Featurepreneur will pick the random contributor (whoever meets the basic contributor requirements) and reward them with Tact coins. Those Tact Coins will be delivered weekly in the Spin Time Event. The title CrowdEngine Contributor of the week will be stored in the Featurepreneur Archive.

**Do I need to be good at programming to contrite the CrowdEngine?**

In short No. 
Not all tasks are programming based. So, non-programmer can contribute this CrowdEngine as well.
