## What is Featurepreneur?

Featurepreneur is similar to freelancer but only Machine Learning and Data enthusiast can work on it. Unlike freelancer websites, Featurepreneur doesn't focus on money but volunteer work.

Also, volunteers can propose a feature for your product by assessing your existing features. So, you don't need to spend much time on writing a new requirement which needed for your audience. Your volunteers might have done it properly. You should just take 'em if you like and give some Tact coins (like Google credits) and a recommendation letter.

However, employers can chip out some money if they like the feature they got from the ML Engineers. Also, employers can give recommendation letters to the volunteers after the proper delivery.

## How can I use Feature Shop?

Just sign up, login and start sharing your ML requirements in the feature requirements section.
