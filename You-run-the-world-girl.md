A misogynist IIT professor told one girl "You are NOT supposed to get top ranking in IIT, this place is not for you, especially not for girls like you"

The girl committed suicide in 2019.

In 2021, we are planning to teach 1000 girls trendy tech to educate this misogynist world that girls can rule this world too!
