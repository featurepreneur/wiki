# Public Feature Requirements

## FS1011: Baseball autoscoring
I want to take baseball event files and break them into sequence of pitches and the classes of results Each game of baseball consists of 9 innings per team. Each team starts batting until there are three outs, and then the other team batting. 

So a total of 27 outs per team until there is a winning team. On average a pitcher (bowler) needs around 5 - 6 pitch attempts per man out or for a “hit” to be registered. 

The result would be the code with: 

input : the game selected output: a list of single codes relating to the result of each pitch for each team for that game It’s complicated but at the end it is c coding problem, rather than a sports problem https://www.retrosheet.org/eventfile.htm 

Note: This is one of our mentor’s small app request. We can fund the volunteers who can wok on this task. You come up with a plan and we will help you out to get it done. 

Benefits: Feature Shop benefits (check above or talk to Sameena) Testimonial from a Canadian (in both LinkedIn recommendation and a hand written format)
