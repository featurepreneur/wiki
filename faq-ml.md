Frequently Asked Questions (ML Engineers)
What is Featurepreneur?
Featurepreneur is similar to freelancer but only Machine Learning and Data enthusiast can work on it. Unlike freelancer websites, Featurepreneur doesn't focus on money but volunteer work.

Also, volunteers can propose a feature for your product by assessing your existing features. So, employers don't need to spend much time on writing a new requirement which needed for their audience. 

Employers can chip out some money if they like the feature they got from the ML Engineers. Also, employers can give recommendation letters to the volunteers after the proper delivery.

Will I get some money for the work I do?
It depends on the requirement you work on. However, we will not show any amount details in the requirements page. So, you will not have any clue about which requirement has higher amount and which one has lower amount.

Some requirements come up with only recommendation letters. However, we would employers to give a minium of 250 Tact Coins for each requirement. 

Maximum Tact coins can go up to 100, 000 Tact Coins and go beyond that as well. Some of our enthusiasts earned 50,000 Tact Coins in beta mode in 2018-2019.

Would it be single phase delivery or multpile phases?
Some requirements come up with single phase. If the employer likes, they can come up multiple phases and Tact coins for each phase. 

Some of our employers like to give away small Tact coins to find the right volunteers and hiken up their Tact coins in the next phases as things go well. It is completely up to the employers and we can't do anything with it.
